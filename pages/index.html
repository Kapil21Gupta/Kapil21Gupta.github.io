<h2 class="mt-3">About Me</h2>
<p>
Hello and Welcome to My Homepage!</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently a Research Associate working with 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/stalic" target="_blank">Prof. Cheng Li</a> 
        in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the National University of Singapore. My current work focuses on Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal modeling, with applications in various real-world problems.
        
        <br>
    <br>
       
       I have submitted my PhD thesis in the 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/decision-sciences" target="_blank">Decision Sciences area</a> 
        at the 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/node/9454" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a>, 
        and I am currently awaiting my defense. During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://soudeepd.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Soudeep Deb</a>, focusing on applying spatial and spatio-temporal models to analyze the house price dynamics.
        Before joining IIM Bangalore, I worked as a Senior Data Analyst at 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.indxx.com/" target="_blank">Indxx, LLC</a>. I hold a Master's degree in 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://maths.iitd.ac.in/drupal/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>

    <br>
       My primary field of work is related to bayesian statistics,
    time series data, spatial, spatio-temporal modeling. I am also interested in sports
    analytics, especially problems related to cricket and tennis. At IIM Bangalore, I taught preparatory courses for MBA and PhD programs on quantitative techniques and R programming. I also served as the instructor for the Probability and Statistics course in the <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/programmes/nsrpredoc" target="_blank">Pre-doctoral Programme</a>. Additionally, I worked as a research consultant with the 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/reri/" target="_blank">Real Estate Research Initiative (IIMB-RERI)</a>, contributing to impactful projects in real estate research.
