<h2 class="mt-3">About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hello and welcome to my homepage. 
    I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/decision-sciences-and-information-systems" target="_blank">Department of Decision Sciences</a> 
    at <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a>.
    Prior to this, I was a visiting assistant professor at 
    the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank">University of Maine</a>.
    I completed my Ph.D in Mathematics under the supervision of
    <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~kong/" target="_blank">Prof. Qingkai Kong</a>
   from <a href="https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Northern Illinois University</a> in 2017.

    <p style="color:#0000FF">This year I am in the job hunt. I am looking for a tenure-track position in mathematical sciences. 
        I am planning to consolidate all relevant informations available via this website.</p>
    
   <br>
    
    I work in differential equations, primarily in boundary value problems and eigenvalue problems. 
    I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to 
    differential equations. Lately, I started to push my boundaries and decided to jump into nonlinear partial differential equations. 
    I am always happy to chat about my work and interested to know about my peers work. If you are interested, please feel free to to contact me.
    If you are a student and interested to work with me, please send me an email with your interest and background and we can
    have a conversation about that.

    Beside mathematics, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and traveling.
    I have traveled to 35 states within the USA and I envision being a member of the <a href="https://allfiftyclub.com" target="_blank">50 state club</a> someday.  
    I am a gastronomer and enjoy seafood the most (living in New England helps!). 
    Italian and Japanese are two of my favorite cuisines- for me, distance is a mere number for fine cheese and delectable sushi! 
    Other than the food, I am passionate about coffee, perfume, and single malt scotch. Cheers to that!
