       My primary field of work is related to bayesian statistics,
    time series data, spatial, spatio-temporal modeling. I am also interested in sports
    analytics, especially problems related to cricket and tennis. At IIM Bangalore, I taught preparatory courses for MBA and PhD programs on quantitative techniques and R programming. I also served as the instructor for the Probability and Statistics course in the <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/programmes/nsrpredoc" target="_blank">Pre-doctoral Programme</a>.
