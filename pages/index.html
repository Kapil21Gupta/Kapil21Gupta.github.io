<h2 class="mt-3">A little about Me</h2>
<p>
    Welcome! Thank you for stoping by. At <a href="https://uconn.edu" target="_blank">UConn</a>, 
    I am a visiting assistant professor in the <a href="https://math.uconn.edu" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> . 
    Prior to this, I was a visiting assistant professor at 
    the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank">University of Maine</a>.
    I completed my Ph.D in Mathematics under the supervision of
    <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~kong/" target="_blank">Prof. Qingkai Kong</a>
   from <a href="https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Northern Illinois University</a> in 2017. 
    
    <br>
    
    My research interests are in mainly in differential equations, primarily in boundary value problems and 
    eigenvalue problems. I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to 
    differential equations. Lately, I started to explore some areas of mathematical physics and inverse problems.
