    <p style="color:#ff0000">This year I am in the job hunt. I am looking for a postdoctoral position in applied statistics. 
        </p>
    
   <br>
    
    I work in differential equations, primarily in boundary value problems and eigenvalue problems. 
    I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to 
    differential equations. Lately, I started to push my boundaries and decided to jump into nonlinear partial differential equations. 
    I am always happy to chat about my work and interested to know about my peers work. If you are interested, please feel free to to contact me.
    If you are a student and interested to work with me, please send me an email with your interest and background and we can
    have a conversation about that.

    Beside statistics, I enjoy playing basketball, reading and singing.
