<h2 class="mt-3">A little about Me</h2>
<p>
    Welcome! Thank you for stoping by. At <a href="https://uconn.edu" target="_blank">UConn</a>, 
    I am a visiting assistant professor in the <a href="https://math.uconn.edu" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> . 
    Prior to this, I was a visiting assistant professor at 
    the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank">University of Maine</a>.
    I completed my Ph.D in Mathematics under the supervision of
    <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~kong/" target="_blank">Prof. Qingkai Kong</a>
   from <a href="https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Northern Illinois University</a> in 2017.

    My research interests are in mainly in differential equations, primarily in boundary value problems and 
    eigenvalue problems. I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to 
    differential equations. Lately, I started to explore some areas of mathematical physics and inverse problems. I am always happy to chat
    about my work and interested to know about my peers work. If you are interested, feel free to look at my publications. Please do not hesitate 
    to contact me. If you are a student and interested to work with me, please send me an email with your interest and background and we can
    have a conversation about that.

    Besides research and teaching, I enjoy travelling. I have lived in Texas, Illinois, Maine and now in Connecticut. I have traveled to 35 states and I can 
    see myself as a member of the <a href="https://allfiftyclub.com" target="_blank">50 state club</a>. I like hiking and rock climbing. There are few things 
    I am extremely particular about. For example, coffee, perfumes and single malts. I am a food lover and I enjoy seafood the most (living in new england is helpful!).
    Italian and japanese are two of my fevorite cuisine. I can go anywhere for good cheese and sushi.
