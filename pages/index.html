<h2 class="mt-3">About</h2>
<p>
    I am a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics 
    at the University of Connecticut. My research interests are in differential and difference equations, primarily in boundary value problems and 
    eigenvalue problems. 
    Prior to joining the University of Connecticut, I was a visiting assistant professor at
    the University of Maine.
    I completed my Ph.D in Mathematics under 
    <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~kong/" target="_blank">Prof. Qingkai Kong</a>
   from Northern Illinois University in 2017.
