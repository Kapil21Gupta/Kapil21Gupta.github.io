    Hello and welcome to my homepage. 
    I am a doctoral candidate in the <a style="color:#0000FF" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/decision-sciences-and-information-systems" target="_blank">Department of Decision Sciences</a>

    <p style="color:#00ffaa">This year I am in the job hunt. I am looking for a postdoctoral position in applied statistics. 
        </p>
    
    <br>
    
    My primary field of work is related to bayesian statistics,
    time series data, spatial, spatio-temporal modeling, inference
    for random processes in epidemiology and climate change. I am also interested in sports
    analytics, especially problems related to soccer and basketball.

    Previously, I studied at the <a style="color:#0000FF" href="https://www.iitbhu.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi (BHU)</a>,
    where I completed my Bachelor of Technology (in 2014) in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

    Besides statistics, I enjoy playing basketball, reading, watching sports and singing.
