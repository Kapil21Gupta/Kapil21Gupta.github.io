<h2 class="mt-3">A little about Me</h2>
<p>
    Welcome! Thank you for stoping by. At <a href="https://uconn.edu" target="_blank">UConn</a>, 
    I am a visiting assistant professor in the <a href="https://math.uconn.edu" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a>. 
    Prior to this, I was a visiting assistant professor at 
    the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank">University of Maine</a>.
    I completed my Ph.D in Mathematics under the supervision of
    <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~kong/" target="_blank">Prof. Qingkai Kong</a>
   from <a href="https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Northern Illinois University</a> in 2017.

    <p style="color:#0000FF">This year I am in the job market. I am looking for a tenure-track position in mathematical sciences. 
        I am planning to consolidate all relevant information available via this website.</p>

    My research interests are in mainly in differential equations, primarily in boundary value problems and 
    eigenvalue problems. I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to 
    differential equations. Lately, I started to explore some areas of mathematical physics and inverse problems. I am always happy to chat
    about my work and interested to know about my peers work. If you are interested,  please feel free to to contact me.
    If you are a student and interested to work with me, please send me an email with your interest and background and we can
    have a conversation about that.

    Beside mathematics, I enjoy travelling and traveled to 35 states within the USA. 
    I envision to be a member of the <a href="https://allfiftyclub.com" target="_blank">50 state club</a> someday.  
    Furthermore, my outdoor interests include hiking and rock climbing. I am a food enthusiast and enjoy seafood the most (living in new england helps!).
    Italian and japanese are two of my favorite cuisines. I can go anywhere for good cheese and sushi. 
    I am extremely passionate about coffee, perfumes and single malt scotch.
