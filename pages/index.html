<p>
Hello and Welcome to My Homepage!</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/stalic" target="_blank">Prof. Cheng Li</a> 
        in the <a style="color:#0000FF" href="https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> at the <a style="color:#0000FF" href="https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/28659-kapil-gupta" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a>. My current work focuses on Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal modeling, with applications in various real-world problems.
        
        <br>
    <br>
       
       I have successfully defended my PhD thesis, "Analyzing House Price Dynamics Using Spatiotemporal Models," 
       in the <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/decision-sciences" target="_blank">Decision Sciences area</a>  at the 
       <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/node/9454" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a>. 
       Under the supervision of Prof. <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://soudeepd.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Soudeep Deb</a>, my research focused on developing and applying 
       spatial and spatiotemporal models to understand housing market dynamics.
        Before joining IIM Bangalore, I worked as a Senior Data Analyst at 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.indxx.com/" target="_blank">Indxx, LLC</a>. I hold a Master's degree in 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://maths.iitd.ac.in/drupal/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> 
        from the 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</a>, 
        and a Bachelor's degree in 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="http://www.cse.iiitdm.ac.in/" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> 
        from the 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Chennai</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
       My primary field of work is related to bayesian statistics,
    time series data, spatial, spatio-temporal modeling. I am also interested in sports
    analytics, especially problems related to cricket and tennis. At IIM Bangalore, I taught preparatory courses for MBA and PhD programs on quantitative techniques and R programming. I also served as the instructor for the Probability and Statistics course in the <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/programmes/nsrpredoc" target="_blank">Pre-doctoral Programme</a>. Additionally, I worked as a research consultant with the 
        <a style="color:#0000FF;" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/reri/" target="_blank">Real Estate Research Initiative (IIMB-RERI)</a>, contributing to impactful projects in real estate research.

        Beyond academia, I enjoy playing badminton and tennis, watching Indian cinema, and following sports, especially cricket and tennis.
