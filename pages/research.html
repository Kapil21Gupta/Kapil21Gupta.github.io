    Primarily, I work on different aspects of spatial and spatio-temporal data. I work on application of spatio-temporal model to real life problems from
    different disciplines, such as public health, social sciences and climate change. Following are broadly the topics I have been working on.
    <br>
    1) Categorical ordinal spatio-temporal models.
    <br>
    2) Spatio-temporal modeling
    <br>
    3) Clustering and classification methods
    <br>
    4) Bayesian implementation of methods.
    <br>
    5) Application of statistics in sports, especially basketball.
