    <h3 class="mt-3">Lyapunov-type inequalities</h3>
    
    The Lyapunov-type inequalities plays an important role in the study of various problems
    related to the theory of differential equation such as oscillation, disconjugacy, 
    eigenvalue problems, etc. Due to its importance, the Lyapunov inequality has been
    improved and generalized in many forms of differential equations. We have 
    extensively studied the Lyapunov-type inequalities for several types of linear, nonlinear 
    and fractional differential equations with different types of boundary conditions. 
    In all the cases, we either sharpened the inequality or extended to a general platform.
    There are two important standpoint for this research. First, we were able to obtain the inequalities
    involving the positive and negative parts of a function, as compared to most results in the literature
    which involves the absolute value of the function. Thus we achieved much sharper inequalities 
    compared to the existing results.
    Second, we used the Lyapunov-type inequalities to obtain the existence and 
    uniqueness criteria for a nontrivial solution of a boundary value problem.
    
    <br>
    The Lyapunov-type inequalities are well developed for linear differential equations and 
    there are several works on quasi linear differential equations. However, the inequalities 
    are not so extensive for the non linear differential equations. Additionally, there are very 
    few works for partial differential equations. In the future, we are hoping to dive into this end of the spectrum.
