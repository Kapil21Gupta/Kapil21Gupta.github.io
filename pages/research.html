    Primarily, I work on different aspects of spatial and spatio-temporal data. I work on the application of spatio-temporal models to real estate data to analyze the dynamics of price. 
    Following are broadly the topics I have been working on.
    <br>
    1) Spatio-temporal modeling
    <br>
    2) Bayesian implementation of methods.
    <br>
    3) Clustering and classification methods
    <br>
    4) Divide and Conquer approach
    <br>
    5) Application of statistics in sports, especially Cricket and Tennis
