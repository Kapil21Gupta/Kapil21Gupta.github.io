            <dt class="mt-2 col-md-3">Abstract</dt>: Over the years, women cricketers have garnered little media or societal attention. 
            This study aims to quantify women’s batting performances in one-day international (ODI) matches. The average batting score has traditionally
            been used in cricket to determine a batter’s worth. However, ranking by simple average ignores two important factors in ODI matches: consistency and strike rates.
            To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology for calculating ranks that incorporates Gini-based average scores rather than simple averages and considers batting strike rates
            in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework. 
            As a result, PCA combined with Gini scores can assist cricket fans, coaches, and managers in better understanding a player’s performance.

            The selection of essential variables in logistic regression is vital because of its extensive use in medical studies, finance, economics and related fields. 
            In this paper, we explore four main typologies (test-based, penalty-based, screening-based, and tree-based) of frequentist variable selection methods in logistic regression setup.
            Primary objective of this work is to give a comprehensive overview of the existing literature for practitioners. Underlying assumptions and theory, along with the specifics of their implementations,
            are detailed as well. Next, we conduct a thorough simulation study to explore the performances of sixteen different methods in terms of variable selection, estimation of coefficients, prediction accuracy 
            as well as time complexity under various settings. We take low, moderate and high dimensional setups and consider different correlation structures for the covariates. A real-life application, 
            using a high-dimensional gene expression data, is also included in this study to further understand the efficacy and consistency of the methods. Finally, 
            based on our findings in the simulated data and in the real data, we provide recommendations for practitioners on the choice of variable selection methods under various contexts.

             Under revision.Pre-print available on request. Paper presented at the 8th MathSport International Conference and IMR Doctoral Conference 2023 (one of the 10 papers selected for the conference presentation).

            <dt class="mt-2 col-md-3">Abstract</dt>: This study aims to examine the importance of the game elements of the first set in Wimbledon matches. Our initial exploratory analysis reveals 
            that winning the first set is often the key to winning the match eventually and the behaviour of game elements also change across the rounds. 
            Motivated by our findings, we identify what factors may have the most significant impact in deciding the match outcome based on the first set data only. 
            We propose a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) induced logistic regression model to identify the effects of the variables. 
            The primary analysis suggests that the service points and average distance travelled by a player turn out to be the most significant factors in deciding the match outcome.
            Further, we find that the association of tennis professionals (ATP) rating points have a significant impact on the match outcome across the tournament. Finally, 
            we show that our proposed LASSO-induced logistic model with a suitable random effect structure can be used effectively for within-match forecasting during the first set of a match. 
            It is found to provide superior accuracy than other popular statistical and machine learning approaches.

            <dt class="mt-2 col-md-3">Abstract</dt>:    Statistical research in real estate markets have garnered attention in recent times from the perspective of understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of the house prices. 
            Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is generally used for Bayesian inference in spatio-temporal modeling. 
            However, standard techniques of MCMC are usually slow for large datasets such as the real estate data, 
            due to the requirement of multiple passes through the entire data in each iteration. This paper proposes a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach
            to tackle this problem. The method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets of sufficient locations and utilizing 
            an appropriate Gaussian process model for each subset in parallel. The parameters corresponding to each subset are then combined 
            to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows us to assess the spatially varying impact
            of various factors on the house-price dynamics. It is also proved to be much faster than a conventional Bayesian approach. As a real life application of the proposed model, we analyze house price data from 
London from January 2011 to October 2019, covering 53 bi-monthly time points and 
906 middle layer super output areas (MSOAs). The results furnish insightful analysis, and render good predictive accuracy, 
            as demonstrated from a cross-validation study. In summary, this work provides a solution to the problem of slow computation 
            in Bayesian inference for spatio-temporal modeling with massive datasets, paving the way for promising future research in this area.

            <dt class="mt-2 col-md-3">Abstract</dt>:  Recent attention has been drawn to statistical research in real estate markets, 
            aiming to comprehend the dynamic patterns of real estate prices in terms of space and time.
            Our study contributes to this field by presenting compelling evidence of the spatial and temporal dependence in real estate prices.
            We introduce a novel statistical model that captures the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies of the real estate prices efficiently. 
            Our proposed model employs a separable Gaussian spatio-temporal process, incorporating an additive mean structure and a random error process. 
            We implement our model through a bayesian setup as it gives flexibility and computational advantage over other approaches. 
            As a real life application of the proposed model, we analyze house price data from Bangalore from January 2015 to March 2020, covering 62 monthly time points and
76 micro-markets. The analysis of residual diagnostics confirms that the model effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependence pattern present in the data.
            Furthermore, the model has been demonstrated to outperform the linear, spatial and temporal models in terms of its predictive capabilities.
