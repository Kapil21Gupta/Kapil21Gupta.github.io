My office hours are MWF: 1-1:50, MONT 406. 
If you wish to meet some other time, please set up an appointment by sending an email to sougata.dhar@uconn.edu. 
On a typical week, other than my office hours, you can certainly catch me in my office between 3pm-5:30pm. 
Other than this, the best way to reach me is to send an email. 
I will respond within 30 mins. 
If you don’t see my reply in an hour, that means I am really busy and trying to get back to you as soon as I am done. 
If you don’t see my reply within 24 hours, call 911 as I am probably dead!
